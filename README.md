# What is this?

A **external cheat for CS2**, made using python, pymeow, and dearpygui.

## Setup.
[Python](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.9/python-3.11.9-amd64.exe)

## Installation.

1. Download the release, then extract it.

2. Run `setup.py`
   - This will automatically install all required dependencies

If the automatic installer doesn't work:
- In the folder containing requirments.txt, open a command prompt.

   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## How to use this?

1. **Launch Counter-Strike 2**
2. Run `launcher.py`

# Troubleshooting!

>[!IMPORTANT]
PyMeow ModuleNotFoundError? Uh-oh! Don't worry, follow these instructions and it will be fixed in no time.

[PyMeow](https://github.com/qb-0/PyMeow)

Download the latest release. Rename the pyMeow folder to exactly *pymeow*

Right click in the folder, click **"Open In Terminal"** \ For Windows 10 - Open powershell, and cd to the place you have the pymeow folder.

`pip install pymeow*.zip` 

If you get an error

Try:

 `pip install pymeow.zip` 

This should fix the pyMeow error.

If these don't work, I believe you can extract the pymeow folder, cd into it and run **`pip install .`**

# Black screen OR AMD GPU?

From testing, AMD GPU's seem to have a black screen issue when using most overlays (pyMeow included), to fix this I have added a some what compromise. When launching the cheat, click onto the GUI menu, and then click onto CS2. You will have to configure the settings and then drag the menu to the bottom of the screen. I do not know of a way to completely hide the menu while fixing the overlay.

### What if I have a NVIDIA GPU?

For NVIDIA GPU's you should not have this black screen problem, simply uncheck Always On Top in the settings and click the minimize button to completely hide the menu until you need it.

### "[Skeleton ESP] Error: Unexpected error encountered: 2D Position out of bounds"
- Can be caused by a lot of reasons.
- Make sure your game is Fullscreen Windowed \ Windowed.
- An easy way to make sure your game stays in FS windowed and doesn't switch to windowed, is to launch the game, set it to fullscreen windowed, then close it and relaunch it and not mess with any settings.

# "Cannot find Main.py module error"
- Please make sure you're running the launcher script in the same folder where the sub-folder `\cheat` is contained.
