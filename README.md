>[!IMPORTANT]
If it says pyMeow can't be found, here's what you need to do:

Go to `https://github.com/qb-0/PyMeow` 
Download the latest release and extract it. Rename the pyMeow folder that contains the actual pymeow code to exactly *pymeow*

Right click in the folder, click **"Open In Terminal"** 
`pip install pymeow*.zip`
This should fix the pyMeow error.

# Setup
- Python installed --> `https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.13.5/python-3.13.5-amd64.exe`
- Counter-Strike 2 installed


# Installation

1. Download the zip folder to your computer, then extract it.

2. Run `install.bat`
   - This will automatically install all required dependencies

3. Run the cheat by clicking on main.py, if this does not work, open a command prompt in admin, and navigate to the folder you have main.py in `https://www.howtogeek.com/659411/how-to-change-directories-in-command-prompt-on-windows-10/`
- Type 
``` py main.py ```


If the automatic installer doesn't work:
- In the folder containing requirments.txt, open a terminal.

   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# How to use?

1. Launch Counter-Strike 2
2. Get into a match, do not launch the cheat in the main menu.
3. Double click main.py, or do what is said in step 3 of installation if it won't launch.


# Troubleshooting
If you encounter a "Cannot find Main.py module error" make sure you're running the launcher script `main.py` in the same folder where the folder `\cheat` is contained.
If you encounter warnings like
- [Security] Warning: Could not enable debug privileges
- [Security] Warning: Could not hide process

These are completely normal, and are nothing to worry about.
