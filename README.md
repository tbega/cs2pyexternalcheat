>[!IMPORTANT]
If it says pyMeow can't be found, here's what you need to do:

Go to https://github.com/qb-0/PyMeow
Download the latest release. Rename the pyMeow folder to exactly *pymeow*

Right click in the folder, click **"Open In Terminal"** \ For Windows 10 - Open powershell, and cd to the place you have the pymeow folder.
`pip install pymeow*.zip` \ if that returns an error
Try:

 `pip install pymeow.zip` 

This should fix the pyMeow error.

If you have an AMD GPU, you might encounter an issue where you can see the overlay, but everything else is black. To fix this please click on the menu, then cs2, and make sure the menu stays open, drag it to the bottom of the screen so it is out of your way. Sadly, I do not know another fix for AMD GPU's.

# Setup.
- Python installed https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.13.5/python-3.13.5-amd64.exe (Direct download link) \ https://www.python.org/downloads/ (Download page)
- Counter-Strike 2 installed


# Installation.

1. Download the zip folder to your computer, then extract it.

2. Run `install.bat`
   - This will automatically install all required dependencies

If the automatic installer doesn't work:
- In the folder containing requirments.txt, open a terminal.

   `pip install -r requirements.txt` \ pip install psutil pywin32 requests pyMeow dearpygui keyboard pynput

# How to use this?

1. Launch Counter-Strike 2
2. Run the cheat by clicking on main.py, if this does not work, open a command prompt in admin, and navigate to the folder you have main.py in.

If you do not know how to use command prompt to navigate go here:

 **https://www.howtogeek.com/659411/how-to-change-directories-in-command-prompt-on-windows-10/**

3. Type `py main.py`

# Troubleshooting!
If you encounter the error "Cannot find Main.py module error" make sure you're running the launcher script `main.py` in the same folder where the folder `\cheat` is contained.

--- 
# Other errors.
If you encounter the error "[Launcher] Failed to run Main module: Unexpected error encountered: Process 'cs2.exe' not found" or a command prompt simply flashes for a second not giving you enough time to read:
- Run the main.py script as admin.

---

If you encounter the error "[Skeleton ESP] Error: Unexpected error encountered: 2D Position out of bounds" 
- Make sure your game is Fullscreen Windowed \ Windowed.
- An easy way to make sure your game stays in FS windowed and doesn't switch to windowed, is to launch the game, set it to fullscreen windowed, then close it and relaunch it and not mess with any settings.
