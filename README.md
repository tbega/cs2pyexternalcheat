>[!IMPORTANT]
If it says pyMeow can't be found, here's what you need to do:

Go to `https://github.com/qb-0/PyMeow` 
Download the latest release and extract it. Rename the pyMeow folder that contains the actual pymeow code to exactly *pymeow*

Right click in the folder, click **"Open In Terminal"** 
`pip install pymeow*.zip`
This should fix the pyMeow error.

# Installation

1. Download the zip folder to your computer, then extract it.

- Type 

` py main.py `


If the automatic installer doesn't work:
- In the folder containing requirments.txt, open a terminal.

   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# How to use?

1. Launch Counter-Strike 2
2. Get into a match, do not launch the cheat in the main menu.
3. Run `main.py.`


# Troubleshooting
If you encounter the error "Cannot find Main.py module error" make sure you're running the launcher script `main.py` in the same folder where the folder `\cheat` is contained.

If you encounter warnings like
- [Security] Warning: Could not enable debug privileges.
- [Security] Warning: Could not hide process.

These are completely normal, and are nothing to worry about.

# Other errors
If you encounter the error "[Launcher] Failed to run Main module: Unexpected error encountered: Process 'cs2.exe' not found" or a command prompt simply flashes for a second not giving you enough time to read:
- Run the main.py script as admin.

---

If you encounter the error "[Skeleton ESP] Error: Unexpected error encountered: 2D Position out of bounds" 
- Make sure your game is Fullscreen Windowed \ Windowed.
- An easy way to make sure your game stays in FS windowed and doesn't switch to windowed, is to launch the game, set it to fullscreen windowed, then close it and relaunch it and not mess with any settings.

---

Any errors like "nimpy.AccessViolationDefect: Unexpected error encountered: Read failed [Address: 0x0000000000001324] [Error: 299 - Only part of a ReadProcessMemory or WriteProcessMemory request was completed.]"
Are due to:
- You ran the cheat in the main menu and not in game.
- The cheat isn't running as admin.
