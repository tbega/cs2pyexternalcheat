`VERY VERY FUCKING IMPORTANT`
If it says pyMeow can't be found, here's what you need to do:
Go to https://github.com/qb-0/PyMeow, download the latest release. Extract it using winrar or Window 11's native folder extractor, put it inside a folder and open a command prompt, navigate to that folder by typing 
`cd ADDRESS-TO-FOLDER-HERE` then rename the folder to exactly *"pymeow"*
Then type 
`pip install pymeow*.zip`
Once this finishes, the pymeow error SHOULD be gone. please.. guys, pymeow is just weird okay :sob:

If the automatic installer doesn't work:

## to use

2. **Run the cheat** by executing `python main.py` in the cheat folder \ or by double clicking main.py
3. game


The GUI is divided into several sections:

- **Max Distance**: Set maximum ESP range (1-100 meters)

### Security Warnings

When you start the cheat, you may see these warnings:
- `[Security] Warning: Could not enable debug privileges`
- `[Security] Warning: Could not hide process`

**These are normal** and occur because:
- Debug privileges require administrator rights
- Process hiding is not possible from user-mode Python without a kernel driver

To minimize these warnings:
- Run the cheat as Administrator (right-click â†’ "Run as administrator")
- Even as admin, some warnings may still appear due to Windows security restrictions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No module named 'Main'" Error**:
- Ensure you're running `python main.py` from the correct folder

**Cheat doesn't detect CS2**:
- Make sure CS2 is running before starting the cheat
- Try running both CS2 and the cheat as Administrator
- Verify CS2 window title matches what the cheat expects

**ESP not showing**:
- Check that ESP features are enabled in the GUI
- Ensure you're in a game with other players
- Verify the max distance setting isn't too low
- Make sure the game window is active and not minimized

**Performance issues**:
- Lower the ESP distance limit
- Disable unnecessary ESP features
- Close other resource-intensive programs

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the console output for error messages
2. Verify all dependencies are installed correctly
3. Try running both the game and cheat as Administrator
4. Make sure your Python version is compatible (3.11+)
